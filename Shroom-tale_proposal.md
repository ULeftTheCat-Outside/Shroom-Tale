**Backstory:**

World/setting:

* It takes place outside. With the mushroom people look extremely small. With only trunks being visible from the tree. Grass is like three times taller than them. The clothes are made of grass, leaves, flowers, or anything else found in the woods or outside. Houses can be made out of acorns or seeds.   
  World’s Lore/ Character’s History:  
* One day mushrooms started to gain consciousness. At first there was peace since they all just roamed around just staring at stuff. Soon after, anarchy started to break out. Their new world is in chaos. What caused the mushroom to gain life is by the life flower that is located far away. Its pollen got transferred long and far by bugs and the wind. The things that got touched by the pollen gain intelligence. The more pollen that was passed on to them the more intellectual they became. The beings that unknowing passed on the pollen around became “god-like”, they became like a deity.   
* They don’t like how the world is and wish to leave it behind. It will explore the rest of the world to attempt to run away from his small mushroom world. Not all mushrooms are mean and self-centered but they all aren’t the friendly-est. He doesn’t really care how they all gained consciousness; he just wishes to leave his ”town” behind. But he will soon learn of the truth since he decided to leave his area.

**Characters:**

Protagonist:	They are small mushroom guy.  He has small empty eyes. Small tiny body. With a small leaf for clothing. He wishes to explore outward to leave the mushroom people for once and all. 

Antagonists: 

Bosses are other intellectual things he encounters as he travels. They have gone “corrupted” or “overly-enlightened” ; they have gained too much knowledge that they can’t handle.

 	Mythological figures (True Bosses) \-  The insects that personally interact with the flower. That they are beings that are completely gone. 

Other key characters:

	A mushroom lady that owns a shop that sells the mc stuff from time to time. 

**Target Audience:**

	Those that like pixel/2d games and games where the world isn’t in the human world but fantasy. Ages teens \- 30s. I think they will like it because of the art style and the vibe of the story. 

**Player Motivations:**

For the story, exploration, and the open world fighting and bosses.

**Unique Selling Point (USP):**

That at the end the MC will become an eldritch being just like the ones he has been fighting. Playing as a small mushroom guy.

**Inspirations & Competition:**

	Tails of Iron \- The progression of the MC from being weak to strong. That as the story goes on he gets equipment that can make him more powerful.

	(havent played personally but heard alot about) Hollow knight \- 2D game with it being bug inspired. A plague has over come him world. 

Competition: 	Tails of Iron- My game the MC becomes strong cuz he just happens to encounter danger. While the MC becomes strong to avenge his father and claim the throne and protect his kingdom.
